DESCRIPTION :

Overview -

The Advanced Encryption Tool is a Python-based utility developed to provide secure encryption and decryption of files using robust cryptographic standards. The tool is built for educational, research, and personal use, offering a hands-on experience with cryptographic principles such as symmetric encryption, key management, and secure file handling.

This project primarily uses the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm with a 256-bit key in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode to ensure data confidentiality. AES is one of the most widely trusted and used encryption standards in both government and private sectors. The tool demonstrates how AES encryption can be implemented in Python to secure sensitive files such as documents, images, and plain text.

It is suitable for students studying cybersecurity or cryptography, developers looking to integrate secure file handling into their applications, or anyone who wants a lightweight encryption solution to protect their files locally.

Purpose - 

The purpose of this tool is to:

Provide a practical understanding of file encryption and decryption processes using symmetric cryptography.

Help students and professionals learn about data security and how to implement AES encryption.

Demonstrate how cryptographic libraries like PyCryptodome can be used to build custom security tools in Python.

Encourage secure data storage practices in both personal and educational environments.

Features -

AES-256 Encryption: Uses the AES algorithm with a 256-bit key size for strong security.

CBC Mode: Implements Cipher Block Chaining mode, which adds an extra layer of security by incorporating an IV.

Password-Based Key Derivation: Uses a password entered by the user to derive a cryptographic key using a secure hash function.

File Support: Encrypts and decrypts any type of file (text, PDF, image, etc.).

Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems with Python installed.

User Interaction: Provides a command-line or IDLE-based interface that prompts users to choose encryption or decryption and supply the required password and file path.

Error Handling: Includes basic checks for file availability, encryption key correctness, and output file naming to prevent overwrites.

How to Use -

Install required library:

pip install pycryptodome
Clone or download the repository.

Open the script using IDLE or any Python-compatible terminal.

Follow the prompts:

Choose to encrypt or decrypt.

Enter the full file path.

Enter a password (used to derive the encryption key).

The tool will generate a securely encrypted version of the file or decrypt a previously encrypted one if the password is correct.

Encrypted files will typically have an .enc extension to differentiate them from original files.

Example Usage -

python encrypt_tool.py
Then follow the prompts:

Enter encrypt or decrypt

Provide the file path

Enter password when prompted

Use Cases -

Protecting sensitive academic or personal files.

Demonstrating encryption in computer science or cybersecurity courses.

Building an understanding of AES encryption and secure coding practices.

Safely storing confidential documents on shared systems or cloud environments.
